    <h3>What They Never Tell You About Being a Morning Person</h3>
        <p>Do you want to be a morning person and enjoy the pleasures of being awake and 
        active before sunrise? Are you trying to beat the habit of waking up late and 
        looking for ways to increase your productivity in the morning? If so, you’ve probably
         watched countless YouTube videos and read enough articles about how to be a morning person.
        On the surface, it looks easy, right? The truth is, waking up early has so 
        many perks. You even have extra time to whip up a healthy breakfast, 
        read a book, and get all your day’s work done. However, before you get there, 
        there are hurdles you have to overcome. </p>
        <p>           
        People will tell you how rewarding being a morning person is, 
        but not many will prepare you for the next few weeks after you decide 
        to set your alarm at 5 or 6 a.m. Knowing what to expect prepares you 
        psychologically so you can tackle the challenges head-on. <a href="https://developproductivehabits.com/what-they-never-tell-you-about-being-a-morning-person/">Learn more about the challenges..</a>

        <h3>4 Tips for Setting Up an Office in a Small Apartment</h3>
        <p>Did you know over 70% of people globally work from home at least once a week? 
            
            If you are one of these, you know the perks that come with not having 
            to put up with the 9-to-5 hustle. However, working from home comes with 
            its own set of challenges — you need a dedicated room to set up an office.
            If you live in a small apartment, the limited space makes it challenging 
            for you to designate a workspace or even invest in home office furniture.
             Unfortunately, failure to set up a working area as a work-from-home 
             professional is one of the sure ways to reduce your productivity. 
             Working in bed or in front of the T.V exposes you to distractions 
             which hinder productivity and efficiency.
        </p>       
        <p> So how do you set up a functional workspace in a small apartment            
            and maintain optimal productivity as you would in an office premise?
